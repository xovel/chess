1.e4 {Notes by Steinitz.} d5 2.exd5 Nf6 3.Bb5+ c6 {Not as good
as 3...Bd7 4.Bxd7+ Qxd7, and if 5.c4 ...c6,etc.} 4.dxc6 bxc6

h6 17.Bf4 Nf6 18.Rae1 Be6 19.Be5 {It could in no way improve
his position to give up the a-pawn, and moreover, it would
have greatly strenghtened his Q side to advance b3.} Bxa2
20.Bxf6 Rxe1 21.Rxe1 gxf6 22.c4 {The attempt to shut out the
adverse QB is futile, and he only exposes himself to greater
attack on that wing.} Rd8 23.Bf1 Bb3 24.Qe2 Bxc4 {Finely
played, for if 25.Qxc4 Bxf2+ 26.Kh1 Bxe1 27.Nxe1 Qf2, followed
by Rd1 and wins.} 25.Qc2 Bxf1 26.Rxf1 Qb5 27.Nh4 Rd5 28.g3 Qd3
{Much better was Bd4.} 29.Qa4 Qb5 30.Qg4+ Rg5 31.Qc8+ Kh7
32.Qd7 Qc4 33.Rd1 Qe6 34.Qd3+ Kg7 35.Qc2 Re5 36.Kg2 Bb6 37.Rd2
Rc5 38.Qd1 Rd5 39.f3 Re5 40.f4 Re1 41.Nf5+ {Black's last move
was a grave error and White takes hold of the attack with
great ingenuity. He must win the exchange for if Black move
the King, White answers Qg4, winning still more easily. The
rest of the game is a struggle against hope on Black's part.}
