1.Nf3 {Notes by Nimzowitsch} d5 2.b3 c5 3.e3 Nc6 4.Bb2 Bg4
5.h3 Bxf3 6.Qxf3 e5 7.Bb5 Qd6 8.e4 {We have here to do with
the remarkable situation which we have already had occasion to
notice, namely the one in which we do not at once cause the
doubled Pawns by Bxc6+, bxc6, but rather bring this about by a
roundabout way. As a matter of fact after 8 Bxc6+?, bxc6, we
should never be able to force our obstinate opponent to
accomodate us by playing ...d4, e.g., 8.Bxc6+ bxc6 9 e4 Nf6
etc.} d4 9.Na3 {Threatening 10 Nc4 Qc7 11 Bxc6+ bxc6 and the
weakness of the doubled Pawns is evident.} f6 10.Nc4 Qd7
11.Qh5+ {The manouver of the Queen is intended to help prevent
Black's castling on the Q side; not on the K side as one might
at first site think.} g6 12.Qf3 Qc7 {Not ...O-O-O because of
Na5 and the covering move ...Nge7 is ruled out because of
Qxf6.} 13.Qg4 {! Now she rejoices in the observation post she
has won for herself. This Q manouver has quite a hyper-modern
air to it.} Kf7 {White threatened 14 Qe6+ Kd8 (or ...Be7 15
Na5) 15 Bxc6 and the unpleasant doubled Pawn is a fact.} 14.f4
h5 15.Qf3 exf4 16.Bxc6 {At the right moment, for the Q dare
not retake. For instance 16...Qxc6 17 Qxf4 Re8 18 O-O!! Qxe4
(...Rxe4 Ne5+) 19 Qc7+!! and wins (19...Qe7 20 Nd6+ followed
by 21 Nxe8)} bxc6 {At last White has achieved his end, at the
cost it is true of a Pawn, but here this plays but a
subordinate role.} 17.O-O g5 {For (see the previous note)
Black's position can be broken up. (Obviously White must not
allow Black to safeguard his position by Kt...e7-g6-e5.) To
break up Black's game three Pawn moves are necessary, (i) c3
(ii) e5 (iii) h4. If White contented himself with only two of
these his work were but half done. In the game all three are
brought about.} 18.c3 {!} Rd8 {Now this Rook is happily
tethered! (to his Pawn at d4).} 19.Rae1 {!} Ne7 20.e5 Nf5
21.cxd4 {!} Nxd4 {If 21...cxd4 then 22 exf6 Kxf6 23 Qe4 and
...Ng3 is impracticable on account of Bxd4+} 22.Qe4 Be7 {The
reply to ...f5 would have been Qb1, an attacking move in the
best modern spirit. For example, 22...f5 23 Qe4 Ke6 (to
protect the f-Pawn) 24 Qd3! and 25 Nd6! with a decisive
attack.} 23.h4 {! Now the undermined Black position tumbles
like a house of cards.} Qd7 24.exf6 Bxf6 25.hxg5 {For after
25...Bg7 26 Ne5+ Bxe5 27 Qxe5 Black's King is a pathetic
figure in his helplessness.} 1-0
