1. c4 {Notes by Alekhine} e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7
5. d3 {More promising is 5 e3 as played (with the colors
reversed by Botvinnik against Alexander in the 1st round.}
Nge7 6. Bd2 O-O 7. Nf3 Nd4 {The idea of protecting the square
d5 with a pawn is in harmony with the character of the
position.} 8. O-O c6 9. Rc1 {White is not in a hurry, and
obviouly prepares for a long positional battle.} d6 10. b4
Nxf3+ 11. Bxf3 Bh3 12. Re1 Qd7 13. b5 c5 14. Ne4 {An original
move, preventing for the moment 14...h6 because of 15
Bxh6. Black should answer it by 14...Kh8 and if 15 Rb1 then h6
16 Qc1 f5 17 Nc3 Kh7 with a perfectly satisfactory
position. Black's next two moves are not actually weak, but
show lack of a general plan.} Qc7 15. Rb1 Bd7 16. Qc1 b6 {?
One might call this tempting providence in the most definite
way. Why leave the rook on the diagonal of the hostile bishop?
The natural 16...f5 17 Nc3 Rae8 followed if necessary by b6
would leave White with only an insignificant positional
advantage.} 17. Bg5 {! The refutation of Black's last move, as
he cannot now play ...f6 because of 18 Bxf6 Bxf6 19 Nxf6+
followed by 20 Bxa8.} Nf5 {A desperate attempt to save the
exchange.} 18. Nf6+ Bxf6 19. Bxf6 Rab8 {He cannot play Rae8 as
he needs that square for the knight.} 20. Bg4 {! Obviously
forced.} Ng7 21. Qh6 Ne8 22. Be7 Ng7 23. Bf6 {Saving time for
the next moves.} Ne8 24. Be7 Ng7 25. Bxf8 Rxf8 26. Bf3 {After
the loss of the exchange, Black has no more fighting chances,
as Dr. Lasker promptly demonstrates.} Nf5 27. Qd2 Nd4 28. Bg2
Bc8 29. e3 Ne6 30. f4 Bb7 31. a4 f5 32. Bxb7 Qxb7 33. Qg2 Qe7
