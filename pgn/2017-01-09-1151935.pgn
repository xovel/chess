1.d4 {Notes by Lasker.} d5 2.Nf3 e6 3.Bf4 c5 4.e3 Nc6 5.c3 {If
White had to make such a narrowing move, his opening would not
be commendable; the move, however, is not necessary. The
threat of Qb6 can also be met by 5.c4 after ...Qb6, White has
then the choice of 6.Qb3,Qd2 and even Qc1.} Nf6 6.Nbd2 Be7
7.Bd3 O-O 8.h3 {Before Castling, he wishes to provide a
retreat for the Bishop against Black's Nh5; but the move
deprives the Bishop of the strong foothold at g3.} Bd6 9.Ne5
{White's position is no longer favorable. Relatively best was
9.Bxd6 Qxd6 10.Rc1, followed by Bb1 and c4. The move played
gives Black the superiority on the Queen's wing, without
obtaining any sufficient compensation for it.} Bxe5 10.dxe5
Nd7 11.Nf3 f6 {Black now obtains an excellent development.}
12.exf6 Nxf6 13.O-O Qe7 14.Ne5 Nxe5 15.Bxe5 Bd7 16.c4 Bc6
17.Rc1 b6 18.b3 Rad8 19.Qe2 Qf7 20.Rfd1 Rd7 21.Bb1 Rfd8 22.Qc2
Qh5 23.Qb2 {White wants to avoid Bxf6, which would open the
g-file for Black, whose Bishop aims already at White's g2
square; but now Black obtains other advantages.} dxc4 24.Rxd7
Nxd7 25.Bg3 {After 25.Bxg7 Black would win by 25...e5.} cxb3
26.axb3 {If 26.Qxb3, Black would force the exchange of Queens
by Qd5.} Nf6 27.f3 Qd5 28.Re1 Be8 29.Bh4 e5 30.Bc2 Qe6 31.Qc3
Bf7 32.Ra1 Rd7 33.g4 Bg6 {By driving White's KB from the
diagonal or exchanging it for his Bishop, Black is enabled to
bring his Knight into play with decisive effect at d5, or (if
e4 ) at d4. The finish is vigorously played by Black.} 34. Bd1
Bd3 35.Bg3 e4 36.f4 Nd5 37.Qe1 Qf6 38.Rc1 Qb2 0-1
