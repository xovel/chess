1.d4 {Notes by Lasker.} d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.c4 dxc4 4.e3 e6 5.Bxc4
a6 6.O-O c5 {First of all he should carry out the intention of
his last move, of playing b5, and Bb7.} 7.a4 b6 {And now it
was more important to play Be7 and Castle, than to adopt this
somewhat slow maneuver.} 8.Qe2 {White now brings a Rook
rapidly into play, attacking the little mobile Queen, and
obtains forthwith a great superiority in the center.} Bb7
9.Nc3 Nc6 10.Rd1 Qc7 11.d5 exd5 12.Bxd5 Be7 13.e4 O-O 14.e5
Ne8 15.Qe4 Na5 {Black is in difficulties as White threatens
Bf4, followed soon by e6. White's formation is
overwhelming. But by the text move Black loses immediately, as
after 16.Bxb7 Qxb7 the exhange of Queens followed by Rd7, and
after 16...Nxb7 17.Nd5 would decide the game at once.} 16.Bxb7
1-0
