1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4
5. a4 Bf5 6. Ne5 {I considered it vital to find out
immediately what defence my opponent had in mind against the
line he himself adopted in the first game.} e6 {! Played twice
by Bogoljuboff against me in the 1929 match. As the experiment
did not succeed (he only managed to draw one game with great
difficulty and he lost the other game), the move 6...e6
disappeared from master practice. But, as was proved
especially by the eleventh game of this match, it is much
safer than the fashionable Kmoch variation (6...Nbd7 in
conjunction with Qc7 and e5.)} 7. Bg5 {As after 7 f3 Bb4, the
move 8 e4? would provoke the absolutely sound sacrifice
8...Nxe4! (first played by Mikenas against Dr. Vidmar, Prague,
1931), White must not hurry to form a pawn centre. Still,
after the following answer, he had no better move than 8 f3,
which would lead to the position obtained in the fourth and
eleventh games.} Bb4 {Much more logical and better than
7...Be7 , as played by Bogoljuboff in our fifth match game in
1929.} 8. Nxc4 { Very harmless, inasmuch as Black, instead of
the complicated variation actually selected, could simply play
here 8...h6, and if 9 Bh4 then 9...g5 10 Bg3 Ne4 11 Rc1 (or 11
Qb3 Na6) c5,etc., with at least equal prospects.} Qd5 {Also a
good move which leads after a short, sharp intermezzo to an
equally balanced position.} 9. Bxf6 {The alternative, 9 Ne3
Qa5 10 Nxf5 Qxf5 etc., was even less promising. And if 9 Qb3,
then 9...Na6.} Qxc4 {Better than 9...gxf6 10 Ne3 Qa5 11 Qb3
with slightly better prospects for White.} 10. Qd2 {The only
move, as 10 Rc1? would have been refuted by 10...gxf6 11 e4
Qa2, etc.} gxf6 11. e4 Qb3 12. exf5 Nd7 13. fxe6 fxe6 14. Be2
O-O-O 15. O-O {These last few moves were practically forced
and the position thus reached offers about equal attacking
possibilities for both sides.} e5 {This logical move�which
brings the knight into a strong position and opens the queen's
file to Black's advantage�has been, in my opinion, unduly
criticized. In any event 15...Nb6, which was recommended
instead, would expose Black to dangerous threats after 16 a5
Na4 17 Qe3 Nxb2 18 Rfc1�and this without offering him any real
winning prospects.} 16. dxe5 Nxe5 17. Qc1 Bxc3 {As 18 Ne4 was
not really a strong threat, this exchange should have been
postponed till a more appropriate moment. Black should have
played 17...Rhg8; for if 18 Ne4 (18 Qe3 Qxb2) then ...Nf3+ 19
Bxf3 Qxf3 20 Ng3 Qg4, etc., with quite a satisfactory
position. After the move in the text White obtains the better
chances because his bishop will prove superior to the knight
as soon as the Black piece is dislodged from e5.} 18. bxc3
Rhg8 19. Qe3 Kb8 {Not absolutely necessary, as he could
indirectly protect his queen rook's pawn by playing 19...Qd5
20 g3 Qd2; but then after 21 Qxd2 Rxd2 22 Rfe1 (here if ...Nd3
23 Rad1!) White's endgame chances would still be the better.}
20. g3 Rd7 21. Rab1 {!} Qc2 22. Rfe1 {! The most subtle move
of the game, by which White prepares the important f4. The
immediate advance of that pawn would be refuted by 22...Rd2 23
Rfe1 Nd3.} Qd2 23. Qxd2 Rxd2 24. f4 Ng6 25. Bc4 Rgd8 {Or
25...Rg7 26 Re8+ Kc7 27 Kh1! with advantage to White.} 26. Re6
{! In order to exchange one pair of rooks. It must be noted
that Black cannot play 26...Rc2 on account of 27 Ba6 b6 28
Rxc6.} R8d6 27. Rbe1 Kc7 28. Rxd6 Rxd6 {If 28...Kxd6, then 20
Bg8, threatening both 30 Bxh7 and 30 Re6+.} 29. h4 {In order
to play the king to f2 without being disturbed by the rook
check on the second rank.} Kd7 30. Kf2 Ne7 31. Kf3 Nd5 {After
this loss of time Black's position becomes rapidly hopeless,
as the White king will be able to attack and win the pawn on
h7. But it is to be doubted if the game could be saved even by
the best answer, 31 ...f5 Then White would not play
immediately 32 g4 because of 32...fxg4+ 33 Kxg4 Rg6+, followed
by 34...Nf5 with counterattack; but he would play first 32 h5,
after which g4 would free his king bishop's pawn with
disastrous effect for Black since the latter's majority on the
queen side has a nominal value only, owing to the passive
position of his pieces.} 32. Bd3 h6 33. Bf5+ Kd8 34. Kg4 Ne7
{Or 34...Nxc3 35 Kh5 Nxa4 36 Kxh5, followed by the victorious
advance of the passed king rook's pawn.} 35. Bb1 Ke8 {If
35...Rd5 then 36 f5, etc.} 36. Kh5 Kf7 37. Ba2+ Kf8 38. Kxh6
Rd2 {The main variation was 38...Nf5+ 39 Kg6 Nxg3 40 f5
followed by the advance of the rook's pawn.} 39. Be6 Rd3
40. g4 Rxc3 41. g5 {Even simpler than 41 Rd1 Nd5. If
41...fxg5, then fxg5.} 1-0
