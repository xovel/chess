d4 {So early in the opening the positions were naturally well
balanced up to this point, when Black commits himself to a
grave error of position judgement that practically delivers
his game to a powerful hostile attack. 7. ...dxc4 8. Rd1 Bd7
would have kept the game still even. -- Steinitz} 8.O-O-O

clear to his keen perception.} e5 9.e3 Bc5 10.exd4 exd4 11.Nd5
