1.d4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch} e6 2.e4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7
5.e5 Nfd7 6.Bxe7 Qxe7 7.Qd2 O-O 8.f4 c5 9.Nf3 f6 {It would be
more in the spirit of a corrct attack on a pawn-chain first to
play 9...cxd4 10 Nxd4, and not till then 10...f6. But after
10...f6 11 exf6 Qxf6, the position arrived at is after all
similar to that of the text.} 10.exf6 Qxf6 11.g3 Nc6 12.O-O-O
a6 13.Bg2 Nb6 {The diagonal attacking range g2 to d5 is a
necessary element in White's plan of operations; for this,
after exf6, hols up the freeing thrust ...e5 better than any
other possible disposition could.} 14.Rhe1 Nc4 15.Qf2 b5
16.dxc5 {! Bravo! the flank attack ...Nxb2 has no terrors for
him, since a flank attack by itself can never ruin a strongly
centralized game. And White's game is centralized, for he
holds the center files and pressure in them is already making
itself felt, and further he has the prospect of occupying the
central points d4 and e5. Observe now how Black's attack is
thrown back by action in the center.} Nxb2 17.Kxb2 b4 18.Nd4
{!} bxc3 19.Ka1 {The c-pawn will be gobbled up presently by a
rook.} Nxd4 {If 19...Bd7 then 20 Nxe6 Bxe6 21 Rxe6 followed by
Bxd5.} 20.Qxd4 Rb8 21.Re3 g5 {Now he has a go on the other
wing.} 22.Rxc3 gxf4 23.gxf4 Bd7 24.c6 Qxd4 25.Rxd4 Be8 26.Bh3
Rf6 27.c7 {It would have pleased me even better if the
decision had been brought about in a bishop ending instead of
through the somewhat "tacked on" action of the passed pawn at
c7; for instance from such a position as White: King at e5,
bishop at h3, pawns at a2, c3, f4, h2. Black: King at e7,
Bishop atf7, pawns at a6, d5, e6, h7; with the continuation
f5, ...exf5, Bxf5 and white wins the d-pawn and the game. We
should then have the general idea more markedly broughtout,
namely first to keep the e-pawn and the d-pawn under
restraint, then to blockade them and only at the end to
destroy them. But as played the game was instructive enough!
(e.g., moves 13, 16, and 18). } Rc8 28.Rxd5 Rxc7 29.Bxe6+ 1-0
