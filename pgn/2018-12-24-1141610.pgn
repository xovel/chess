1.e4 {Notes by Emanuel Lasker} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6
5.O-O Be7 6.Qe2 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 O-O 9.d4 exd4 10.cxd4 Bg4
11.Rd1 d5 {White was threatening e5, followed by Bd5.} 12.e5
Ne4 13.Nc3 Nxc3 14.bxc3 f6 {Premature. He should have played
...Na5 first.} 15.h3 Bh5 {Obviously ...Be6 was ruled out by 16
exf6 Rxf6 17 Bg5 Rg6 18 Bc2. As for ...Bf5 16 g4! this was
just as unpleasant for Black as ...Bc8 16 a4 with numerous
threats, such as Qa2.} 16.g4 Bf7 17.e6 {This had to be very
carefully considered. It was risky to give Black his d6-square
and to face the possibility of the advanced pawn being cut off
from his fellows by ...f5.} Bg6 18.Nh4 Na5 19.Nxg6 {This
exchange was necessary since, after 19 Bc2 Bxc2 20 Qxc2 Nc4 21
f4 Nd6 22 f5 Ne4 White would have bottled up his lines of
attack.} hxg6 20.Bc2 f5 21.Kh1 Bd6 22.gxf5 Qh4 23.Qf3 gxf5
24.Rg1 {Threatening Bg5, as well as 25 Bxf5 Qf6 26 Qg2.} f4
25.Rg4 Qh6 26.e7 Bxe7 27.Bxf4 Qe6 {Seeing that 28. Rxg7+ would
be immediately decisive Black resigned even before White had
moved.} 1-0
