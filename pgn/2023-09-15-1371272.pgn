1.e4 {Notes by Eric Schiller. This game featured a major upset
in the U.S. Open. Gabriel Schwartzman is a very talented young
Grandmaster but he runs into a creative sacrifice in this
game.} e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e5 {The old Steinitz variation
is enjoying renewed popularity these days. A game between
Kasparov and Short at the 1994 Euwe Memorial in Amsterdam had
made a deep impression on me, and I was hoping to make use of
a plan involving h4, Rh3-g3 and a kingside attack that worked
well for Kasparov.} Nfd7 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3 Qb6 8.Qd2
{The pawn sacrifice offered by this move has rarely been
tested in the tournament arena. I was quite surprised when
Schwartzman accepted it.} Qxb2 9.Rb1 Qa3 10.dxc5 {This was my
own idea. 10.Be2 was recommended in an old book by Harding,
but it did not impress me at all. I decided to eliminate the
dark-squared bishops and use Kasparov's attacking formation on
the kingside.} Bxc5 11.Bxc5 Qxc5 12.Bd3 a6 13.h4 Nb6 {13...Qe7
would have made it harder for me to justify the investment of
the pawn.} 14.Rh3 {!} Nc4 15.Bxc4 Qxc4 16.a3 {! This is a very
important move. I need to free the knight from the need to
hang around at c3 just to defend the poor pawn.} b5 17.Ne2 Bd7
18.Nfd4 {! This eliminates the enemy knight, and I have a
decent endgame even without the pawn, because Black is left
with a very bad bishop.} Nxd4 19.Nxd4 Rc8 20.Rbb3 {! There are
two points to this move. One is to be ready to transfer to the
kingside at a moment's notice, and the other, more subtle,
will be revealed shortly.} O-O 21.Rhg3 f6 {Standard French
counterply.} 22.f5 {!? I hadn't worked out all the tactics
here. But I had a great deal of confidence and had seen some
pleasant long variations, beginning at move 27!} exf5 {This
fell in with my plans. But what about the alternative? Could I
have held the position following:} ( 22...fxe5 23.Qh6 Rf7

have been a simple matter to find all these moves at the
board!} 33.a4 {keeps White in the game. A draw is quite
possible.} ) 28.Qe6+ Rf7+ 29.Rf3 Rcf8 {! White has no good
moves.} 30.h5 Qxc2 31.Qxd5 {is still extremely
complicated. Black gets connected passed pawns after} Qc1+

pinned!!} 33.Rxd4 Qe7 {!} ( 33...b4 {?} 34.Qxf7+ {!} Rxf7

cannot unpin without dropping a rook except by getting the
king to g7.} b4 ( 34...g6 35.h6 b4 36.Kg1 {! breaks the pin.}

Black king when it is at h7.} ) 23.Rbc3 {! A critical
preparatory move before the real attack begins.} Qa4 {The rest
of the game is virtually forced.} ( 23...Qa2 24.Qh6 Rf7 25.e6

things up.} ) 24.Qh6 Rf7 25.exf6 {!} g6 {Forced, but Black's
defenses cannot hold.} 26.Rxg6+ {!! The rook is sacrificed for
two pawns and a tremendous attack.} hxg6 27.Qxg6+ Kf8 28.Qh6+

promotes. Black is powerless to prevent it.} 1-0
