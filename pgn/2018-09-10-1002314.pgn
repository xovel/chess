1.e4 {Analysis by Wilhelm Steinitz.} e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 {The
old attack, which ought only to equalize the game, whereas, we
believe 3. d4, recommended in the Modern Chess Instructor,
gives White a manifest superiority.} d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5
6.Bd3 Be7 7.O-O O-O 8.c4 Nf6 {A very good move, if properly
followed up.} 9.Nc3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Bg4 {Instead of this pinning,
which, as usual, is disadvantageous, Black should have played
Nbd7, followed by Nb6, so as to keep command of the isolated
d-pawn, which White could not well advance in the meanwhile,
as Black would afterward continue the attack upon it by Bb5.}
11.Be3 Nc6 12.a3 a6 {Qd7 was much better.} 13.b4 Bd6 14.Be2 h6
15.Qd2 Nh7 16.Ne4 Be7 17.h3 Bf5 {Here and afterward, it would
have been much better to withdraw the bishop right back to c8
at once, where he has ultimately to take refuge.} 18.Ng3 Bg6
19.d5 Nb8 20.Ne5 Nf6 21.Bc4 Ne4 22.Nxe4 Bxe4 23.Rae1 Bh7 24.f4
Bd6 25.Bd4 Bf5 26.g4 Bd7 {Compare our previous note.} 27.f5 f6
28.Ng6 Re8 29.Nf4 Bxf4 30.Qxf4 Kh7 31.Bc3 {White has obtained
an overwhelming superiority of position, which would have
warranted a sacrifice of the exchange at this point which was
likely to lead to a more brilliant finish. 31. Re6 was the
right move, for if 31. ...Bxe6 32. fxe6 and Black could never
escape the effects of the double action of White's Queen and
KB on the open diagonal, besides the bearing of bishop and
rook against the f-pawn.} Rxe1 32.Rxe1 Bc8 33.Qe4 Qd6 34.Kg2
Nd7 35.Qe8 b5 36.Re7 {This finishes the game virtually.} Ne5
