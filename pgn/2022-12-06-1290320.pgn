1. e4 {This game was awarded the prize for 'the best attacking
combination'. Notes by Raymond Keene. } e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6
{It is a foible of mine that I have usually preferred this
risky move to 3...c5 which gives good chances of equality,
according to theory.} 4. e5 Nfd7 5. Bd3 {The most formidable
try for White is 5 f4, seeking to create an unassailable
central bulwark. In that case, however, I would like to
suggest 5...c5 6 c3 Nc6 7 Ndf3 Qb6 8 g3 and only now 8...Qa5!?
'sacrificing' a tempo. The point is that 7...Qa5 can be met
strongly by 8 dxc5! Qxc5, when Black's queen is misplaced and
White can utilise d4 as a springboard for his pieces. With the
insertion of the extra move g2-g3 this line is less impressive
for White, since his kingside has been loosened and it is
impossible, for example, to transfer a rook along the third
rank from f1 via f3 to g3 or h3 where it could otherwise have
participated in an attack against Black's cramped king's
wing.} 5...c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. Ne2 cxd4 8. cxd4 f6 9. exf6 {If 9
Nf4 Black can offer an advantageous exchange sacrifice to gain
central control with 9...Nxd4! (that is why it is important to
exchange on d4 at move 7 before playing ...f7-f6) 10 Qh5+ Ke7
11 Ng6+ hxg6 etc.} 9...Nxf6 10. O-O Bd6 11. Nf3 Qc7 12. Nc3 a6
13. Bg5 {! White's plan, and a highly dangerous one for Black,
is to gain control of the dark squares by means of the
manoeuvre Bg5-h4-g3. Note, however, that White must be
cautious with his move order. If 13 Re1? O-O 14 Bg5 then
14...Ng4! 15 h3 Nxf2! 16 Kxf2 Bg3+ gives Black a winning
attack.} 13...Ng4 {!? My new idea, introduced for the first
time in this game. The logic of the bold knight move is to
employ Black's aggressively posted pieces to challenge White
on his home territory - the dark squares. 13...Ng4 was
mentioned in Informator 21 as one of the important theoretical
novelties of 1975. By transferring the king's knight from f6
(via g4 and h6) to either f5 or f7, Black hopes to intensify
his dark square operations, mainly directed against White's
queen's bishop.} 14. h3 Nh6 {White can now place Black's
position under immense strain with the subtle 15 Qb1!,
e.g. 15...Nf7 16 Bxh7 Nxd4 17 Nxd4 Nxg5 18 Qg6+ Kf8 and now
either 19 Qxg5 or Bellin's interesting piece sacrifice 19 f4!?
Nxh7 20 f5 Kg8 21 fxe6. Another super-sharp possibility,
suggested by Timman, is 15 Qb1 Rf8!? 16 Bxh7 Rxf3 simply
offering a positional exchange sacrifice to dislocate White's
momentum. In the game White falls in too readily with Black's
schemes.} 15. Bxh6 {? It looks good to inflict doubled
isolated h-pawns on Black's position, the more so since White
can easily prevent Black from castling into queenside safety,
but this turns out to be a near fatal error.} 15...gxh6
16. Qe2 O-O {! A surprising move, castling into the shattered
wing, but it soon transpires that Black can build up intense
pressure against White's exposed kingside pawn-front by
massing his major pieces on the f- and g-files, and combining
this with the activity of his bishop pair.} 17. Rad1 Qg7
18. Kh1 Kh8 19. Bb1 Rg8 20. g3 {White's position is clearly
critical and from now on he also begins to defend weakly. He
should have minimised targets with 20 Rg1, although the rook
would then be poorly placed.} 20...Bd7 21. Rfe1 {If 21 Na4
Raf8 22 Nb6 Be8 23 Qxe6 Bc7-+.} 21...Raf8 {The finishing touch
to Black's mobilisation. White now accelerates the end by
allowing Black's queen's bishop to join in the attack.}
22. Ne5 {?} Nxe5 23. dxe5 Bc5 24. Rf1 Bc6 25. Qc2 Rf7 {Black
could already play 25...Bxf2 26 Rxf2 d4+ 27 Ne4 Qxg3, but in
any case White has no constructive moves left.} 26. Rde1 {The
concluding combination is not very difficult, but what
influenced the prize judges was probably the logic of a dark
square counter-attack beginning with 13...Ng4!? and
culminating in ...} 26...Bxf2 {!} 27. Rxf2 Qxg3 {If 28 Rxf7
Qxe1+ or 28 Nd1 Qxh3+ 29 Rh2 Qf1+ 30 Rxf1 Rxf1 mate.} 0-1
