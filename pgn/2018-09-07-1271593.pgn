1. d4 {Notes by Richard Reti} d5 2. c4 c6 3. e3 {Breyer, in
closed games, likes his bishops to keep behind his chain of
pawns. Therefore he avoids early exchanges and can prepare
undisturbed for the attack. It is surprising in his games how,
when the decisive break through occurs, the pieces which had
appeared shut in, suddenly become alive.} Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5. Bd3
Bd6 6. f4 {! This is obviously better than Nf3. A player in
the habit of playing according to routine would not however
have had such ideas.} O-O 7. Nf3 dxc4 {Black intends after 8
Bxc4 with ...b5 and ...b4 and ...Ba6 to bring out his queen's
bishop, which usually is locked up in this opening.} 8. Bb1 {!
A surprise! Black's B at c1 remains blocked in. White plans an
attack against the Black king's position. In this plan it is
essential that he does not play Bc2 but Bb1.} b5 9. e4 Be7
10. Ng5 h6 {After ...g6 follows 11 h4, h5.} 11. h4 {Threatens
now with 12 e5 Nd5 13 Qc2 g6 14 h5 to overturn the castled
position. Compare the note to 8 Bb1.} g6 {The only move that
parries the threat. Simultaneously Black threatens to take the
knight at g5.} 12. e5 hxg5 13. hxg5 {If 13 exf6 Bxf6 14 hxg5
Bxd4 and Black would have the advantage.} Nd5 {White has
sacrificed a piece. How ought he to continue the attack? After
14 Qg4 Black defends himself sufficiently by ...Kg7 and
...Rh8.} 14. Kf1 {A problem move which soon shows itself
directed against the defensive possibility of ...Kg7.} Nxc3
{As to 14...Bb4 see the note at the end of the game.} 15. bxc3
Bb7 16. Qg4 Kg7 17. Rh7+ Kxh7 18. Qh5+ Kg8 19. Bxg6 fxg6
20. Qxg6+ Kh8 21. Qh6+ Kg8 22. g6 Rf7 23. gxf7+ Kxf7 24. Qh5+
Kg7 25. f5 {Now in a few moves the apparently blocked queen's
wing comes into action.} exf5 26. Bh6+ {After 26...Kh7 27 Bf4+
Kg7 28 Qh6+ Kg8! 29 Qg6+ Kh8 30 Ke2 Bh4 31 Rh1 together with
Bg5 wins. For the better understanding of Breyer's combination
we will consider the following which would arise if Black on
the fourteenth move had played ...Bb4 in order to leave the
square e7 free from the queen. Through that White would have
had time for 15 Nxd5 cxd5 16 Be3 and if Kg7 then 17 Rh7+ Kxh7
18 Qh5+ Kg7 19 Qh6+ Kg8 20 Bxg6 fxg6 21 Qxg6+ Kh8 22 Ke2 and
wins.} Kh7 27. Bg5+ Kg8 28. Qg6+ Kh8 29. Qh6+ Kg8 30. Qe6+ Kf8
