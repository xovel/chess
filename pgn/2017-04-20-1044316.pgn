1. e4 {Notes by Bobby Fischer} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 f5 {This
is Matulovic's specialty the same as his gambit in the
Sicilian defence. In blitz games there is no problems for
White because of the Black King's weaknesses. I know this
variation very well and because of that I was surprised at
Matulovic's choice.} 4. Nc3 fxe4 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Nxe5 dxe4
7. Nxc6 Qg5 {7 Qd5 gives probably more problems for White.}
8. Qe2 Nf6 9. f4 Qxf4 10. d4 Qh4+ 11. g3 Qh3 {The same was
played in the game Gheorghiu-Maric, Skopge 1968. Georghiu
played 12Na7+ but he did not get any advantage in this
position. I analyzed this position all night with Robatch and
Gheorghiu in Vinkovci. Gheorghiu showed me that game against
Maric and it was very interesting for me. Our idea was 12 Bg5}
12. Bg5 a6 13. Ba4 Bd7 14. Bxf6 gxf6 15. Qxe4+ Kf7 16. Ne5+
fxe5 17. Rf1+ Ke7 {Black has many problems. If 17...Kg8 18
Rf6! Re8 (if 18...Bxa4 19 Qd5+ with Qf7 mate) 19 Bb3+ Kg7 20
Rf7+ Kh6 21 dxe5 with a winning attack. If 17...Qxf1 18 Kxf1
Bxa4 19 Qf5+ wins.} 18. Bxd7 Kxd7 {If 18...Qxd7 19 O-O-O and
Black's King and Queen are attacked.} 19. Rf7+ Ke8 {?? Be7!!
gave good chances for a successful defence.} 20. Rxc7 Bd6
21. Rxb7 Rc8 22. O-O-O Qxh2 23. dxe5 Be7 24. Rxe7+ {After this
move Black has no hope. Maybe I had an easier way to win, but
thought I had not enough time. As a matter of fact I had three
minutes.} Kxe7 25. Qb7+ Ke6 26. Qd7+ Kxe5 27. Qd5+ Kf6
28. Rf1+ Kg6 29. Qf5+ Kh6 30. Qe6+ Kh5 31. Rf5+ Kg4 32. Rf4+
