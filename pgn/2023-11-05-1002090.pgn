1.e4 {Notes by Blackburne.} e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nc6 {The other
Knight is better. In some forms of this opening it is of
importance to be able to advance P-QB4.} 4.Nf3 Bb4 5.Bd3 Nf6
6.e5 {PxP leads to an old drawing variation.} Ne4 7.Bd2 Nxd2
8.Qxd2 h6 {Probably intended as a waiting move, but it creates
a weakness on the King's side.} 9.O-O O-O 10.Qe3 Bxc3 11.bxc3 Na5
{Trying to force an opening on the Queen's side.} 12.Nd2 b6
13.f4 Qe7 14.Rf3 c5 15.Rg3 f5 {If P goes to B5, White plays
P-B5; and if PxB, then P-B6, winning.} 16.exf6 Qxf6 17.Rf1
cxd4 18.cxd4 Nc6 19.c3 Ne7 {Now he is able to guard the weak
Kt-3, and threaten an exchange by Kt-B4.} 20.Qe1 Nf5 21.Rh3
Nd6 22.Rff3 Bd7 23.g4 Rf7 24.Qg3 Ne8 {He has no means of
repelling the King's Knight's Pawn, and so brings his Knight
round to defend his most vulnerable point. If instead he had
played:- 24...P-KKt4 25.PxP QxP 26.QxKt RxR 27.RxR... and
wins.} 25.g5 {Now the attack is overwhelming.} hxg5 26.fxg5
Qd8 27.Qh4 Rf5 {Giving up the exchange but he had nothing
better. If 27. ... K-Bsq 28.RxR+ KxR 29.P-Kt6+ K-Bsq 30.R-B3+
Kt-B3 31.Q-R8+ K-K2 32.QxP+ ... winning easily.} 28.Bxf5 exf5
29.Re3 {To prevent the King escaping to the Queen's side.} Kf8
{He might as well have resigned now.} 30.Qh8+ Kf7 31.g6+ Kf6
32.Rhg3 {He cannot escape mate next move.} 1-0
