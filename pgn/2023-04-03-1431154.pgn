1.d4 {(Notes by GM Ray Keene.) World champion Vladimir Kramnik
fought back to take game 10 of the match in Elista and now
leads by three to two in terms of games actually won. However
Kramnik's forfeit from game five has still not been rescinded
by FIDE, the world chess federation, and Kramnik has announced
his intention of suing FIDE after the match in the Court of
International Sports Arbitration in Lausanne. FIDE has already
lost one case there to the former women's world champion Susan
Polgar.} Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 Bb4+ 5.Bd2 Be7 6.Bg2 O-O
7.O-O c6 8.Bf4 Nbd7 9.Qc2 a5 10.Rd1 Nh5 11.Bc1 {White avoids
the exchange of his bishop for Black's knight, as occurred
with colours reversed in the previous game which was published
yesterday.} b5 12.cxd5 {The alternative is the blockading
advance 12 c5 but Kramnik has, to his credit, something
considerably more energetic in mind.} cxd5 13.e4 {The only
logical continuation after the exchange on d5.} dxe4 14.Qxe4
Rb8 15.Qe2 Nhf6 16.Bf4 Rb6 17.Ne5 Nd5 {Black needs just one
more move, ... N7f6, to consolidate and get a perfectly viable
position. Kramnik acts at once with a seemingly antipositional
trade -- surrendering his Catalan bishop in order to thwart
this plan.} 18.Bxd5 exd5 19.Nc3 {Now White will win a pawn but
it would appear that Black obtains plenty of counterplay for
his nominal material deficit.} Nf6 20.Nxb5 Ba6 21.a4 Ne4
22.Rdc1 Qe8 23.Rc7 Bd8 24.Ra7 f6 {?? This is a blunder. It was
essential to play 24 ... Bxb5 25 axb5 Qxb5 26 Qxb5 Rxb5 27 Ra2
when White would retain a small but permanent plus. The move
played loses outright.} 25.Nd7 {In fact 25 Qg4 might be even
stronger for White.} Rf7 26.Nxb6 Rxa7 27.Nxd5 {White has
gained a second pawn and is winning easily.} Rd7 28.Ndc3 Rxd4
29.Re1 {Good enough but after 29 f3 Black will simply lose his
knight.} f5 30.Qc2 Rb4 31.Nd5 Rxb5 32.axb5 Qxb5 33.Nc7 Qc4
34.Qd1 Bxc7 35.Qd7 h6 {White was threatening mate.} 36.Qxc7

42.Bc7 g4 43.Bxa5 {Kramnik's most convincing win so far in the
match.} 1-0
