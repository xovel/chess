1. e4 {Notes by J. Lowenthal} h6 2. d4 a5 3. Bd3 b6 4. Ne2 e6
5. O-O Ba6 {This series of unusual moves was no doubt adopted
with the view of embarrasing the blindfold player, in place of
which it served to allow him to bring out his pieces and
secure victory in a shorter space of time.} 6. c4 Nf6 7. e5
Nh7 8. f4 Be7 9. Ng3 d5 10. Qg4 O-O 11. Nh5 g5 12. fxg5 hxg5
{Black has indeed placed himself in a deplorable condition in
vainly attempting to puzzle his antagonist.} 13. Bxh7+ {Nf6+
would also have led to a speedy termination.} Kh8 14. Nf6 dxc4
15. Bc2 Qxd4+ 16. Qxd4 Bc5 17. Qxc5 bxc5 18. Bxg5 Nc6 19. Rf3
{Threatening mate in two moves.} Kg7 20. Bh6+ Kxh6 21. Rh3+
Kg5 22. Rh5+ Kf4 23. Kf2 {Terminating the game in masterly
style, and giving it an interest, from the nature of the
opening, which we had not looked.} 1-0
