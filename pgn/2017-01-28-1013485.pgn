1. d4 {Notes by Alekhine} Nf6 2. Nf3 b6 3. c4 Bb7 4. g3 e6
5. Bg2 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. b3 {Avoiding the inevitable
simplification that would occur after 7 Nc3 Ne4!} d5
{Recommendable too is 7...c5 since 8 d5 would be answered by
8...Nxd5!, followed by 9...Bf6.} 8. Ne5 c6 {8...c5 is of
course more enterprising.} 9. Bb2 Nbd7 10. Nd2 c5 11. e3
{Sustaing the central tension and at the same time gaining a
certain advantage in space.} Rc8 12. Rc1 Rc7 13. Qe2 Qa8 {?
The rook at c7 is not secure, and this move helps white to
undertake a favourable mobilization. Much better was 13...Qb8,
followed by 14...Rfc8.} 14. cxd5 Nxd5 15. e4 N5f6 16. b4 {!
Taking the greatest possible advantage of the deficient
position of the Black rook at c7.} Rfc8 17. dxc5 bxc5 18. b5
a6 {? Also after 18...Nxe5 19 Bxe5 Rd7 20 Nb3 Black's game
would be inferior but allowing the opening of the a-file is
practically suicidal.} 19. a4 axb5 20. axb5 Qa2 {Keres must
have overlooked the rejoinder. In any case his position is
already hopeless.} 21. Nec4 {!} Qa8 22. Bxf6 {! Winning the
exchange anyway.} gxf6 {If 22...Bxf6 23 b6 or 22...Nxf6 23 Nb6
etc.} 23. b6 Rc6 24. e5 Rxb6 25. Nxb6 Nxb6 26. Bxb7 Qxb7
27. exf6 Bxf6 28. Ne4 Be7 29. Qg4+ Kh8 30. Qf4 {! Threatening
not only 31 Qxf7 but also 31 Nxc5!} Bf8 31. Nxc5 Qc7 {After
32...Rxc5 White would recover the piece either at d4 or at
e5.} 32. Nxe6 Qxf4 33. Nxf4 1-0
