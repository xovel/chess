1. e4 { Notes by Raymond Keene. } g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. f4 {In our
book The Modern Defence George Botterill and I classed this
move as slightly dubious.} 3...c5 {Also possible is 3...d5 4
e5.} 4. c3 cxd4 5. cxd4 Qb6 {!? An innovation. In our book we
recommended 5...d6 as giving Black a good game, but I wanted
to try something sharper.} 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. e5 {White's centre
lurches forward in the interests of
self-preservation. Actually 7 Nc3 was on since 7...Nxd4 8 Nd5
Nxf3+ 9 gxf3! Qd8 10 Qc2 is unhappy for Black - but 7...Nh6!
(with the idea of ...O-O) keeps up the pressure.} 7...Nh6
8. Nc3 O-O 9. d5 {White has to harry the opponent before he
can dismantle the centre completely with ...d7-d6 plus
...Bg4.} 9...Nb4 10. a3 Na6 11. Bd3 d6 12. Qe2 Nc5 13. Bc4 Bg4
14. Be3 {White has little choice but to allow the weakening of
his pawn structure.} 14...Bxf3 {White's position is a
structural wreck but it is not entirely devoid of attacking
prospects.} 15. gxf3 Nf5 16. Bf2 Qc7 17. h4 Rac8 18. Nb5 Qd8
19. Nd4 {On 19 Nxa7 I planned the following powerful exchange
sacrifice: 19...Qa5+ 20 b4 Qxa7 21 bxc5 Qa5+ 22 Qd2 Rxc5! 23
Bxc5 Qxc5 with more than sufficient positional compensation
for the slight material investment.} 19...Nxd4 20. Bxd4 Nd7
{Threatening to exploit the exposure of the bishop on c4 by
continual capturing on e5.} 21. b3 Qc7 22. Bb2 h5 23. Rg1
{Setting the trap 23...dxe5?? 24 Rxg6!} 23...Qc5 24. Rg2
{After this move the peculiar alignment of White's queen and
king's rook permits Black a spectacular combinative blow. On
24 Rg3 Black would have been obliged to pursue the following
course: 24...dxe5 25 fxe5 b5 26 Bxb5 Nxe5 27 Bxe5 Bxe5 28 Qxe5
Qxb5 29 Qxh5 Qd3!} 24...Nb6 25. Rc1 Nxd5 26. f5 {Or 26 b4
Qe3!} 26...Qe3 27. fxg6 {My opponent played this as though it
were decisive but he had not taken into account the reply:}
27...Nf4 {!} 28. gxf7+ Kh8 {Black wins in all variations,
e.g.: a) 29 Rg5 Nxe2 30 Rxh5+ Bh6 31 Rxh6+ Kg7! (but not
31...Qxh6?? 32 exd6+ Kh7 33 Bd3+). b) 29 Qxe3 Nxg2+ 30 Ke2
Nxe3 31 Kxe3 b5! 32 Bd5 Rxc1 33 Bxc1 Bh6+ 34 f4 dxe5 35 Bb2
Bxf4+ 36 Ke4 Kg7 37 Bxe5+ Bxe5 38 Kxe5 Rd8 39 Ke6
Kf8-+. Black's rook soon penetrates to the white hinterland
and eats its fill. As so often, a shock move induces the
opponent to make a very bad reply.} 29. Rxg7 {?} Nxe2 30. Rg8+
{30...Rxg8 31 fxg8=Q+ Rxg8 32 Bxg8 Nxc1+ or 32 Bxe2 Rg1 mate.}
