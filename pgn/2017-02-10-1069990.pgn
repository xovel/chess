1.d4 {Notes by Gary Kasparov.} Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4+ 4.Bd2
Qe7 5.g3 Bxd2+ 6.Qxd2 O-O 7.Bg2 d5 8.O-O dxc4 9.Na3 c5 10.dxc5
Qxc5 11.Rac1 Nc6 12.Nxc4 Qe7 13.Nfe5 Nxe5 14.Nxe5 {Evaluating
this position is not at all difficult-the difference in the
placing of the pieces is too great. But the realization of the
advantage is made difficult by the absence of weaknesses in
Black's position. If he can manage to develop his pieces
without any particular damage, White's initiative will be
neutralized. To do this he must drive the knight at e5 from
its dominating position.} Nd5 15.Rfd1 Nb6 16.Qa5 {!
Restraining Black's Q-side and preventing 16...f6 in view of
17.Nc4 Nxc4 18.Rxc4 with a decisive invasion.} g6 17.Rd3 {!
With his last move Black tried to prepare the exchange of a
couple of rooks, but White forestalls this attempt: 17...Rd8
18.Qc5! Qxc5 19. Rxd8+ Qf8 20.Rxf8+ Kxf8 21.Rc7, with a
crushing position.} Nd5 18.e4 {! It is a pity for White to
block the diagonal of his own bishop, but now it is more
important to drive the black knight from its excellent post.}
Nb6 {Forced in order to cover c7. The attempt to gain some
freedom by tactical means did not work - 18...Qb4? 19.Rxd5}
19.Bf1 {! An unobstrusive, but very important move. In such a
situation the main thing is not to allow the opponent to free
himself. Black was intending to play 19...f6, and after 20.Nc4
to exploit the undefended state of the rook at d3: 20...Nxc4
21.Rxc4 b6 22.Qc3 Ba6. The prophylactic 19.Bf1! prevents this
possibility.} Re8 {It is hard to call this move a mistake, but
at any rate Black's best chance was to sacrifice a pawn by
19...f6 20.Nc4 Bd7, although even then White should gradually
win after 21. Nxb6 axb6 22.Qxb6 Bc6 23.a3.} 20.Rdd1 {! White
has fully coordinated all his pieces, and Black can only
passively observe his opponent's preparation.} Rf8 { There is
nothing else, since it is no longer possible to buy off the
opponent with a pawn sacrifice: 20...f6 21.Nc4 Bd7 22.Nxb6
axb6 23.Qxb6 Bc6 24.Bb5! Bxb5 25.Qxb5 with a straightforward
win. Now Black can only hope for a miracle, or... the
inexperience and haste of his opponent. On the experience of
our previous meetings, the latter seemed more probable, but
the lessons received from Petrosian in Moscow and Tilburg had
taught me a great deal.} 21.a3 {! Insignificant moves such as
this demonstrate to the opponent just how helpless he is.} Kg7
22.b3 {White, with unhurried haste, approaches his goal. It is
obvious that the advance of the pawn to a5 will spell the end
of Black's resistance, but what can he do?} Kg8 23.a4 Rd8
{Even without this oversight the game would not have lasted
long.} 24.Qc5 {! The variation 24...Qxc5 (24...Qe8 25.Ng4!)
25.Rxd8+ Qf8 26.Rxf8+ Kxf8 27.Rc7 does not require any
commentary. Black resigns.} 1-0
