1.e4 {Notes by Steinitz.} e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.O-O
gxf3 6.Qxf3 Qf6 7.e5 Qxe5 8.Bxf7+ {Cochrane adopted this move
first when giving the odds of the QN to inferior players, and
under similar conditions Morphy and other masters also favored
it, for it leads to fine traps into which a Knight player is
likely to fall, and also insures in most continuations a
speedy cooperation of the two Rooks for the attack. But it
actually hampers White's game in playing this variation to
have the QN on the board and lose time in its
development. Altogether this form of the Muzio gambit is relly
to bold for a tournament, and the superiority of material
which Black gains should break the attack soon, as is the case
here.} Kxf7 9.d4 Qf5 {Best for if 9...Qxd4+ 10.Be3, which
piece Black, obviously, dare not capture.} 10.g4 Qg6 11.Nc3
Nf6 12.Bxf4 d6 13.Bg3 Kg7 14.Nd5 Nxd5 15.Qxd5 Nc6 16.Qc4 d5
{The tables are turned with this move, and Black's attack with
superior forces can hardly fail.} 17.Qxd5 Be6 18.Qb5 Be7
19.Qxb7 Qe4 20.Rae1 Qxd4+ 21.Rf2 Bd7 22.Qxc7 Bc5 23.Kg2 Qd5+
24.Rf3 Rhf8 25.Bf4 Rac8 26.c4 Qxf3+ 0-1
