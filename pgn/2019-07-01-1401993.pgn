27. Qh6+ Ke7 28. Rfe1 Rxg3 {Black sacrifices more or less all
of his pieces in what seems to be an orgy of tactics. If you

-- Jacob Aagaard} 29. hxg3 Qxg3 30. Qh2 Rh8 {This is really
the highlight of this wonderful aesthetic combination. Also
possible was 30...Bxg2+?! and White has good chances to hold
the endgame due to opposite coloured bishops, even though the
odds are still with Black. -- Aagaard} 31. Qxh8 Bxg2+ 32. Kg1
