1.e4 {Analysis by Wilhelm Steinitz} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6
4.d3 {White turns the opening into a Giuoco Pianiassimo.} Bc5
5.c3 d6 6.Be3 Bb6 7.Nbd2 O-O 8.Qe2 d5 9.Bb3 h6 {There is here
some reason for this usually weak move, as Black intends to
inconvenience the adverse QB and has no attack to fear on the
K side.} 10.h3 {But on White's part, the precaution is
useless.} Be6 11.Bc2 d4 12.cxd4 Nxd4 13.Qd1 Nxc2+ 14.Qxc2 Qd6
15.Nc4 Bxc4 16.Qxc4 Bxe3 17.fxe3 Qb6 18.Qc1 Rad8 19.Nxe5 Qd6
20.d4 Nxe4 21.O-O c5 {A fine attacking move that ought to have
yielded more by force than it did.} 22.Rf4 Ng3 23.Qe1 cxd4 {By
this exchange, Black loses part of his advantage. He ought to
have retreated Nh5 at once, and then proceded as in actual
play. The difference being that White could not afterward gain
time (compare White's 27th move) again by Ne3, this square
being blocked by his own pawn, a weak one as it stood, of
which, however, he is now relieved.} 24.exd4 Nh5 25.Rh4 Nf6
26.Nc4 Qd5 27.Ne3 Qg5 28.Qf2 Rfe8 29.Nf5 Rd5 30.Rf1 {White has
played very ably to get out of all positive disadvantage, but
for this great blunder the game was even. The right move was,
of course, 30. Rf4, where upon if 30. ...Ne4; 31. Qf1 Nd2
32. Qf2 and no more than a draw ought to be the legitimate
result.} Rxf5 0-1
