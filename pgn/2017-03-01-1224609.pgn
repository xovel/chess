1.e4 {Notes by Karel Traxler} e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 Bc5
{An original combination that is better than it looks. A small
mistake by white can give black a decisive attack. It is not
easy to find the best defense against it in a practical game
and it is probably theoretically correct. ... It somewhat
resembles the Blackmar-Jerome gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4
Bc5 4.Bxf7+?! Kxf7 5.Nxe5+?!} 5.Nxf7 Bxf2+ 6.Ke2 {The best
defense is 6.Kf1! although after 6...Qe7 7.Nxh8 d5 8.exd5 Nd4
Black gets a strong attack.} Nd4+ 7.Kd3 b5 8.Bb3 Nxe4 9.Nxd8
{White has no defense; the mating finale is pretty.} Nc5+
